# Induction-Coupling Architecture (ICA)

ICA is an experimental computing architecture based on controlled
electromagnetic induction coupling for logic and adaptive computation.

## Components
- IDL: Induction-Based Digital Logic
- IAS: Induction-Based Adaptive Synapse

## Current Status
- NAND, NOR, NOT logic gates demonstrated
- 1-bit binary adder demonstrated
- Inductive synapse element (experimental)

## Motivation
This work explores non-transistor computing primitives for
future hardware and brain-inspired systems.

## Stage
Prototype-stage research work.
