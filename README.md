# Induction-Coupling Architecture (ICA)

Induction-Coupling Architecture (ICA) is an experimental hardware-oriented computing framework that explores computation through controlled electromagnetic coupling rather than conventional transistor-based switching.

The objective of ICA is to investigate alternative computing primitives at the hardware level and evaluate their potential for deterministic logic and adaptive behavior.

## Concept Overview

ICA is based on the principle that electromagnetic induction interactions between circuit elements can be structured to represent and process logical states.

Instead of relying purely on transistor switching, ICA explores:
- Inductive signal coupling
- Energy-based logic representation
- Hardware-level interaction dynamics

---

## Current Prototype Status

The following experimental prototypes have been demonstrated:

- Induction-based NOT gate  
- Induction-based NAND gate  
- Induction-based NOR gate  
- 1-bit binary adder implemented using induction-based logic primitives  

These implementations validate the feasibility of constructing deterministic digital logic structures using inductive coupling mechanisms.

## Ongoing Exploration

Current research directions include:

- Scaling logic primitives
- Stability and noise behavior analysis
- Experimental adaptive coupling mechanisms
- Architecture-level abstraction of inductive computing systems

---

## Research Stage

This project is currently in the **prototype-stage experimental research phase**.

The work focuses on validating core hardware principles before large-scale architectural expansion.

---

## Disclaimer

ICA is an exploratory hardware research initiative.  
It does not claim replacement of existing computing architectures but investigates alternative physical computing mechanisms.
